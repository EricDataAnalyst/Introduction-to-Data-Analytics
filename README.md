## Data Analytics Domains
> **Four Pillars help Businesses understand past performance, diagnose issues, forecast future trends and recommend actions to optimize outcomes.**

### Descriptive Analytics (What Happened)
This type focuses on summarizing past events and data. It answers questions like "What Happened" and "What is currently happening" by providing reports and summaries of historical data.
### Diagnostic Analytics (Why did it happen)
This type delves deeper into past data to identify the root causes of events. It answer questions like "Why did it happen" and "What factors contrbuted to this outcome?" by Analyzing the underlying reasons for past performance.
### Predictive Analytics (What is likely to happen in the future)
This type uses historical data and models to forecast future events. It answers questions like "What is likely to happen in the future" by predicting future trends and outcomes.
### Prescriptive Analytics (What should we do?)
This types takes the analysis one step further by recommending actions based on the data and analysis. It answers questions like "What should we do?" by providing actionable insights and recommendations to optimize outcomes.

## Data Types and Data Structures
### Data Types
> Data types define the kind of values that can be stored and manipulated in programming and data analytics. They help ensure that data is handled correctly.
- Common data types include:
  - Numerical (Integer, Float):
    > Represent numbers for mathematical operations.
  - Categorical (Nominal, Ordinal):
    > Used for labeled data like colors or rankings.
  - Boolean:
    > Represents True/False values.
  - Text (String):
    > Holds characters and words.
  - Date & Time:
    > Stores timestamps for temporal analysis.
### Data Structures
> Data structures refer to the ways data is organized and stored to optimize access and processing.
- Common structures include:
  - Arrays & Lists:
    > Ordered collections of elements, often used for simple data storage.
  - DataFrames (Tabular Data):
    > Used in Pandas (Python) or R to store structured, row-column data.<br>
    > Analysts use this to manipulate and analyze tabular datasets.
  - Dictionaries & HashMaps:
    > Store key-value pairs for quick lookups.<br>
    > Key-value pairs for fast lookups.
  - Relational Databases (SQL)
    > Structured tables used in SQL databases for efficient querying and storage.<br>
    > Essential for working with large datasets in business applications.
  - NoSQL Databases
    > Flexible, document-based or graph-based storage, like MongoDB.<br>
    > Useful for handling semi-structured or unstructured data.
  - Graphs & Trees
    > Used in network analysis, hierarchical data (e.g., organizational structures).<br>
    > Analysts working with social networks or recommendation systems often use graph structures.
  - Stacks & Queues
    > Sequential data structures used in algorithm-driven analysis.<br>
    > Often relevant in processing streaming data efficiently

## Stages of Data Analysis Process
### Data Analysis Process
> The data analysis process is a structured way of examining data to extract useful insights and make informed decisions.
#### Data Analysis Core Process
- Define the Problem or Research Question
  > You start by identifying what you want to analyze. Without a clear objective, data analysis can become unfocused and ineffective.
- Data Collection
  > Gather the necessary data from various sources, such as surveys, databases, or online resources. The quality of data directly impacts the accuracy of your results.
- Data Cleaning
  > Before analysis, data must be cleaned by removing errors, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information. This ensures accurate and meaningful insights.
- Analyzing the Data
  > Apply different techniques like statistical analysis, machine learning, or visualization tools to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations.
- Data Visualization
  > Represent findings using charts, graphs, and tables to make complex information easier to understand. A good visualization tells a story without needing too much explanation.
- Presenting Data
  > Finally, the insights are shared in reports, presentations, or dashboards, making it easier for stakeholders to make informed decisions.
